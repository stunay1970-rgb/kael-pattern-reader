# KAEL – Structural Frequency Analysis for Reliable Anomaly Detection
KAEL is a lightweight, frequency-based anomaly detection framework focused on
structural stability rather than point prediction.

Instead of optimizing for accuracy on clean data, KAEL analyzes how signals
behave under stress, noise, drift, and partial degradation.
It is designed as an edge-ready, offline-first structural monitor for
time-series and sensor data.**Drone Stress Test – Structural Frequency Response**

The figure shows KAEL’s frequency-based structural analysis on real or fallback UAV data.
Both low-frequency drift (0.1–1 Hz) and high-frequency vibration components (10–30 Hz)
are detected simultaneously, demonstrating KAEL’s ability to monitor structural stability
under noisy and partially degraded conditions.![![Drone Stress Test – Structural Frequency Response](images/drone_frequency_response.png)
